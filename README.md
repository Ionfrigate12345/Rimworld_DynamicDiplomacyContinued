# Disclaimer:

I'm not the author. But since the author claims that he will not update the mod but give permission to anyone willing to, I do that myself for this is one of my favorite mods.

I didn't test the previous versions but it shall still works. It's only for updating to 1.5, nothing else changed

All thanks to the original author NilchEi for this great mod and especially for the code source on Github.
