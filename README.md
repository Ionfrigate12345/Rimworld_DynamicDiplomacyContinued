I'm not the author. But after updating it to 1.5 I did add some new features, translations and minor fixes. All thanks to the original author NilchEi for this great mod
 
Thanks Dingo Ananas & aRandomKiwi (authors of MercenaryForMe) for png files. I'm not good at GUI designing so I picked your melee attack png as new battle simulation site icon


感谢Shavius的外置汉化包。之前我不知道1.4时已有汉化。为方便已经习惯1.4汉化版的中文玩家，我内置的简繁中文版已改用外置汉化包的翻译。

==============
1.5 UPDATE:

You can now give all 4 incidents extra triggering chances in mod config, making them happen as frequent as you want, up to once every 6 hours.

==============
1.5 UPDATE:

Now the BETA version of "Semi battle simulation" is on. You can check it in mod option and read the mousehover tooltip for more details.

In simple words, it's a mode for players who prefer more intervention of warfares between NPC factions, instead of just watching them fighting each other for fun. The fight wont start until your pawns reach there, or after 2 days timeout it will be resolved automatically without simulation. You can reach them both via vanilla ways or using SOS2 shuttles (SRTS not tested, please feedback if it doesnt work).

Also I tried to fix some issues of NPC spawning in the rock during battle sim. However with Geological Landforms it may still happen for this mod often generate "extreme" mountain maps with few walkable area. If you use Geological Landforms It's recommended to turn off all mountain types in "Landforms" tab of mod config, unless you dont use battle sim at all.

Otherwise old battle sim still works as before, no other change.
